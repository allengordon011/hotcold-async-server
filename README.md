# Hot or Cold

A guessing game.

## Technology Used

This project was built using an async server with Node.js, Express.js, and React-Redux. The server will store the 'record' of the lowest number of guesses it takes to find the randomly generated number. The front-end will display user feedback: 'hot', 'cold', 'warmer', and 'cooler', the number of guesses the user has made in the current game, as well as what the guesses were, and the previous record (if one has been set during that server session).
